## History
ULIS is created and maintained by Cl√©ment BERTHAUD ( a.k.a Layl, a.k.a Robot-Fromage ).  
ULIS began development in December 2018, as a side project during spare time from an  
unexperienced developper. It was first hosted as a repository listed under user  
Robot-Fromage. It was then developped as a part of Praxinos, aiming for robust tools for  
digital image processing. ULIS was first released internaly for Praxinos at the end of  
summer 2019. It made its debut in Iliad, a digital painting plugin for UnrealEngine  
developped by Praxinos. The first version of ULIS had a lot of issues: it was hard to  
maintain and overused template. It resulted in terrible output binary sizes and compile  
times.  
ULIS2, was starting development in beginning of January 2020. ULIS2 was scheduled for  
release in February 2020, and came with a much simpler API. Compile times were drastically  
reduced as well as output binary sizes. ULIS2 brought many things, such as better overall  
performances, support for more models, actual support for AVX2 optimisations, color mix,  
smudge, new blending modes and alpha modes, new interpolation types, etc. The build  
framework was also simplified and extended to conform to the typical cmake build process.  
Optional for GPU image processing with OpenCL was introduced. The library dependencies  
changed and are now embedded in the repository.  
ULIS3 was introduced in March 2020 during a period of high productivity. ULIS3 merged the  
commit history of both ULIS and ULIS2 for future reference and to keep track of what has  
been done since the repository had such a turbulent history, facing many complete rewrites.  
This version corresponds to the age of high-level features, the focus on development has  
shifted from very low level memory operation on pixel buffers towards more complexe  
structures built from these parts, such as Tile Pools and Tiled Blocks, or advanced  
deformation algorithms. ULIS3 also introduces WASM a new available compilation target,  
allowing to run transpiled C++ code on client side in web browsers.

Additional Optional library can be used with ULIS2 to test samples programs or build the python binding:

        Qt5.x
        Python3.x

## Getting Started

        git clone https://github.com/Praxinos/ULIS2
        mkdir ULIS2_Build
        cd ULIS2_Build
        cmake -G ../ULIS2

Sample scripts are also available in the repository to help with the build process.

## ULIS2 for UnrealEngine ThirdParty Module
A `ULIS2.Build.cs` script is provided within the repository.
ULIS2 GPU capabilities and interop with Direct3D or OpenGL in the context of a generic rendering hardware interface is still a work in progress.

## Examples
This is a small sample illustrating image loading, copy and blend operatios. Check samples to get a gist of how to use ULIS2, more details and specific functions.

```cpp
#include <ULIS2>
using namespace ::ul2;

int main() {
    FThreadPool  threadPool;
    uint32 perfIntent = ULIS2_PERF_MT | ULIS2_PERF_TSPEC | ULIS2_PERF_SSE42 | ULIS2_PERF_AVX2;
    FHostDeviceInfo host = FHostDeviceInfo::Detect();
    std::string pathBase = "base_160.png";
    std::string pathOver = "over_160.png";
    FBlock* blockBase = XLoadFromFile( &threadPool, ULIS2_NONBLOCKING, perfIntent, host, ULIS2_NOCB, pathBase, ULIS2_FORMAT_RGBA8 );
    FBlock* blockOver = XLoadFromFile( &threadPool, ULIS2_NONBLOCKING, perfIntent, host, ULIS2_NOCB, pathOver, ULIS2_FORMAT_RGBA8 );
    Fence( threadPool );
    FRect sourceRect = blockBase->Rect();
    int w = sourceRect.w * 8;
    int h = sourceRect.h * 5;
    FBlock* blockCanvas = new  FBlock( w, h, ULIS2_FORMAT_RGBA8 );
    for( int i = 0; i < NUM_BLENDING_MODES; ++i ) {
        int x = ( i % 8 ) * sourceRect.w;
        int y = ( i / 8 ) * sourceRect.h;
        Copy(   &threadPool, ULIS2_BLOCKING, perfIntent, host, ULIS2_NOCB, blockBase, blockCanvas, sourceRect, FVec2I( x, y ) );
        Blend(  &threadPool, ULIS2_NONBLOCKING, perfIntent, host, ULIS2_NOCB, blockOver, blockCanvas, sourceRect, FVec2F( x, y ), ULIS2_NOAA, static_cast< eBlendingMode >( i ), AM_NORMAL, 0.5f );
    }
    Fence( threadPool );
    delete  blockBase;
    delete  blockOver;
    delete  blockCanvas;
    return  0;
}
